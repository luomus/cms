# store-core

This library provides core functionality for the store.
This handles the communication when needed with [database](../database/README.md),
[search index](../search/README.md) and background workers.

This library can be used to communicate with lajistore without
running the needed requests through an API.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test store-core` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
